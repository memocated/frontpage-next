  Hi!<br/>
  We are <strong>Memocate,</strong><br/>
  and we are creating the<br/>
  <strong>aid for dementia.</strong>
stories:
 - h1: A dream of human encounters
   p_1: During her studies Camilla Lindholm worked at a local nursing home. In the work, the interaction skills rose to a key position. Life with the inhabitants was rewarding, but the feeling of inadequacy also surfaced. How to avoid time-consuming misunderstandings? How to interact with a resident whose only words were "yes" and "no"? 
   p_2: These dilemmas of care work led to long-term research on memory diseases and interaction at the University of Helsinki. Research was directed by a strong desire to help and to have a positive societal impact. Memocate was born to convey information from these studies to all who live and work on the same issues on a daily basis.

 - h1: We are <br>Memocate
   p_1: With years gone by, the dream of one person has grown to our common goal goal. We want to improve our customers' lives by facilitating good interaction. Our company was born at the University of Helsinki in order to offer new kind of digital training materials to support the treatment of memory patients. 
   p_2: Our online training platform provides operational models for challenging interaction situations in care as well as giving you the opportunity to process the often uneasy emotions that come with the work. Memory diseases can not be cured, but with effective interaction we can increase the wellbeing of people suffering from dementia, ease the burden related to care work and bring relief to our customers' lives.

 - h1: Our future
   p_1: What makes us special and allows us to produce high-quality training materials is our strong background in science. We will continue to develop and utilize the latest research data also in the future. We develop our service in cooperation with our customers based on continuous feedback we receive from them. Our customers' experiences are the starting point for our work.
   p_2:  The first step is to establish our business and our position in Finland. After five years, we see ourselves operating and educating caregivers also in other European countries. We will influence and create new solutions to challenging care and interaction situations and we will not stop there. Our story is just beginning.
