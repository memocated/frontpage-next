intro:
  Hi!<br/>
  We are <strong>Memocate,</strong><br/>
  and we are creating the<br/>
  <strong>aid for dementia.</strong>
stories:
 - h1: A dream of human encounters
   p_1: During her studies Camilla Lindholm worked at a local nursing home. In the work, the interaction skills rose to a key position. Life with the inhabitants was rewarding, but the feeling of inadequacy also surfaced. How to avoid time-consuming misunderstandings? How to interact with a resident whose only words were "yes" and "no"?
   p_2: These dilemmas of care work led to long-term research on memory diseases and interaction at the University of Helsinki. Research was directed by a strong desire to help and to have a positive societal impact. Memocate was born to convey information from these studies to all who live and work on the same issues on a daily basis.

 - h1: We are <br>Memocate
   p_1: With years gone by, the dream of one person has grown to our common goal goal. We want to improve our customers' lives by facilitating good interaction. Our company was born at the University of Helsinki in order to offer new kind of digital training materials to support the treatment of memory patients.
   p_2: Our online training platform provides operational models for challenging interaction situations in care as well as giving you the opportunity to process the often uneasy emotions that come with the work. Memory diseases can not be cured, but with effective interaction we can increase the wellbeing of people suffering from dementia, ease the burden related to care work and bring relief to our customers' lives.

 - h1: A special product,<br> a special team
   p_1: Our operations make a particularly strong scientific background. We want to help people by adding knowledge and understanding. In addition to our scientific advisor Camilla, our energetic team has extensive expertise in training design coding.
   p_2:  The key to our work is professionalism, communication and innovation. These values shared by us are guided and developed by our daily activities.

 - h1: Our future
   p_1: What makes us special and allows us to produce high-quality training materials is our strong background in science. We will continue to develop and utilize the latest research data also in the future. We develop our service in cooperation with our customers based on continuous feedback we receive from them. Our customers' experiences are the starting point for our work.
   p_2:  The first step is to establish our business and our position in Finland. After five years, we see ourselves operating and educating caregivers also in other European countries. We will influence and create new solutions to challenging care and interaction situations and we will not stop there. Our story is just beginning.

service:
  p_1: We are preparing a new kind of web education service for professional and informal caregivers of people with memory diseases as well as students in the health sector.
  p_2: We work in close collaboration with our customers in order to increase our understanding of memory disease and to improve the interaction between people with memory disease and their caregivers. We also offer contact teaching and consulting according to the needs of our customers.
  p_3: We are currently making the first version of our service. We are looking for partners in our product development and to support expansion internationally.

research:
  p_1: >
    <p>A person with dementia can't always express their feelings and thoughts verbally. The lack of means of expressions may manifest as challenging behavior.</p>
    <p>In the simplest case the person with dementia doesn't for instance notice that they are being addressed if a caregiver doesn't stop right in front of them. This leads to misunderstandings and frustration. Proper communication with a person with dementia is a proven way of non-pharmacological rehabilitation that prevents problematic behavior and makes life easier for people with memory diseases and the people who interact with them.</p>
  p_2: >
    <p>Memocate is based on research made at the University of Helsinki. Since 2005 Camilla Lindholm has researched the interaction between people with memory diseases and their caregivers. In her research she focuses on the strategies that caregivers and people with memory diseases use in their interaction and how the interaction works when one of the parties can't participate equally because of a memory disease. When words disappear and language understanding is harder, the responsibility of keeping the conversation going is transferred to the healthy party. Camilla uses videotaped research material and conversation analysis to bring out details that have previously remained hidden.</p>
